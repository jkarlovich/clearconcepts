      <p class="left">Ren&eacute;e Karlovich has been creating stained glass art for 12 years.  She loves to make
      custom works for family, friends, and clients and is excited to find
      new inspirations and ideas.  She is happily married and a mother of two grown
      daughters.  She has three cats and recently became a grandmother to her youngest daughter's baby girl.
      After over 40 years of teaching in the Bellevue School District, Ren&eacute;e retired in June, giving her more time to work on
      her art.
